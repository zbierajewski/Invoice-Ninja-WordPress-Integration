Invoice Ninja WordPress Integration


This is a nifty little plugin I wrote so that my customers can log in via WordPress and view a services page as well as a billing page. This plugin connects to the InvoiceNinja database and gets a link to the billing portal that you can add to a page via shortcodes.


Installation is simple: Simply drop the PHP file "servicesandbilling.php" into your wp-content/plugins folder, go to the plugins page in the WordPress Dashboard and activate the plugin "Mr. Services and Billing". 

Once activated, use the shortcode [zb_billing] on their respective pages.
